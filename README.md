Lawn Game Olympics Capstone Project: Service Layer

My Service Layer repository will house all of the design documentation for my Lawn Game Olympics capstone project. I am creating this project to use as a game tracker web application. The purpose of this application would be to house information about players that would form them into teams depending on what category they fall in to. These teams would then be assigned opponents for games and the winners of each game will be given points. The application will keep track of game points and total points.
